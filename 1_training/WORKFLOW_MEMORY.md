## SCRIPT GENERATION SYSTEM (START HERE)

When user says "generate script" or "create content" or shares production details, follow this process:

### STEP 1: Read These Files (In Order)
1. `bharath_cycle_hub_tg_research.md` - Understand the target audience
2. `viral_formulas_index.md` - **15 named viral formulas** extracted from 51 @twistedsagar videos
3. `viral_video_decode_framework.md` - Understand viral patterns
4. `twisted sagar content.md` - Study viral creator patterns (@twistedsagar examples)
5. `BCH_Story_Scripts_Hathoda_Effect.md` - Reference the Hathoda Effect format
6. `BCH_Pattern_Interrupt_Hooks.md` - Visual hook techniques (shock motion + face)
7. For deep reference on any formula: read PDF from `Twistedsagar [Deep Analyze]/v[number]/`

### STEP 2: Ask These Questions

**PRODUCTION RESOURCES:**
- How many characters/actors available? Who are they?
- What location(s) can you shoot at?
- What equipment? (Phone/Camera)
- Any props/costumes available?

**CONTENT BRIEF:**

- Which TG segment? (Kids 14-17 / Parents / Adults / Grey)
- Which objection to attack? (Too expensive / Won't use / Safety / Need to ask wife / etc.)
- Any specific product to feature? (Aoki Flex CR / Aoki Cadence / EMotorad / General)
- Any offer to include? (15 Free Accessories / EMI / 24hr Test Ride ₹499 / etc.)

**BOUNDARIES:**
- Drama level allowed? (Crying / Arguments / Flashbacks)
- Comedy style? (Slapstick / Witty / Situational)
- Any topics OFF LIMITS?

### STEP 3: Generate Script Using This Format

```
SCRIPT: "[TITLE]"

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Format | [Multi-character drama / Testimonial / Challenge / etc.] |
| Duration | [30-60 seconds] |
| Platform | [Instagram Reel / YouTube Short] |
| Language | Street Kannada |
| Hook Type | [Shock / Question / Comparison / Gone Wrong] |
| TG Trigger | [From TG research] |
| Objection Attacked | [Specific objection] |

## HOOK [0:00-0:03]
TEXT OVERLAY: "[Exact text with emoji]"
VISUAL: [What viewer sees]
AUDIO: [What viewer hears]

## SETUP [0:03-0:15]
[Full Kannada dialogue with English translation]
[Stage directions in brackets]

## STORY ARC [0:15-0:35]
[Conflict escalation with rapid cuts]
[Full dialogue]

## CLIMAX + BRAND [0:35-0:50]
[Twist/resolution]
[Product integration]
[Feature callouts as text overlays]

## COMEDY PAYOFF + CTA [0:50-0:59]
[Laugh moment]
[End card with CTA]

## PRODUCTION NOTES
- Characters needed
- Key shots
- Estimated cuts

## WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL
[3-5 bullet points tied to TG insights]
```

### STEP 4: Match Resources to Script
- Adjust script based on available actors
- Adjust locations based on what's available
- Note any limitations

### STEP 5: Generate 5 Visual Hooks Per Script
Read `BCH_Pattern_Interrupt_Hooks.md` for techniques, then generate:

```
VISUAL HOOK [NUMBER]: "[NAME]"

[0:00-0:01]
VISUAL: [Face close-up + Motion entering frame]
FACE: [Emotion - defeat/shock/terror/etc.]
MOTION: [What moves - phone slam/calculator/dust/etc.]

[0:01-0:02]
VISUAL: [Reaction + Zoom into eyes]
FACE: [Physical signs - wet eyes/jaw drop/etc.]

[0:02-0:03]
TEXT OVERLAY: "[Specific numbers + Emoji]"
AUDIO: [Sound design - slam → silence → music]

VIDEOGRAPHER:
- Camera setup
- Lighting
- Actor coaching tip

EDITOR:
- Timing (slow-mo, freeze)
- Effects
- Audio layers
```

**Pattern Interrupt Types:**
1. PHYSICAL SHOCK — Throwing, breaking, falling
2. EMOTIONAL FACE — Close-up genuine emotion
3. MOTION + FACE — Action + reaction in same shot
4. AUDIO JARRING — Silence→Loud or Loud→Silence
5. THE STARE — Direct camera stare, no blinking

## AOKI Cadence - Product Module
**File:** [aoki_cadence_product.md](aoki_cadence_product.md)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | E-Cycle, Hybrid Tyres, Stealth Design |
| Price | ₹69,999 → ₹56,999 (discount) |
| EMI | ₹2,499/month |
| Range | 70 KM |
| USP | Looks like regular road bike, hidden battery+display |
| Design | European, white+brown, "Fortuner of E-Cycles" |
| TG | 35+, 10L+/month income, commuters, health+lifestyle |

- Real case: Client came for ₹40K bike, spoke to wife, bought Cadence immediately
- **Script strategy:** Give husband ammo to convince wife / Make wife the hero / Show family benefit

## Content Brain System (In Progress)
**Blueprint:** `/Users/arsalan/Desktop/manual trainnig/content_brain_blueprint.md`
**Purpose:** Convert 500+ viral reels → queryable pattern library for script generation

| emotional_triggers_index.md | Pending | Emotion patterns |
| top_examples_library.md | Pending | Best 50-100 examples |

### How It Works:
1. Extract patterns from 500 reels (one-time)
2. Store in small index files
3. AI reads indexes + TG + Product → generates scripts
4. 96% reduction in context needed
