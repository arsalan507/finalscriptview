## PRODUCTION NOTES

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Characters** | 2 (Staff/Syed Bhai + 1 real kid fan, ~12 years old) |
| **Props** | 12 gift items (helmet, lock, front light, rear light, water bottle + holder, phone holder, bell, air pump, mudguard, reflectors, tool kit, Aoki Flex CR) |
| **Key Shots** | Kid's begging pose, each gift handover reaction, Gift 12 big reveal (slow-mo), kid riding across store |
| **Emotional Level** | HIGH — genuine kid reactions are the content |
| **Estimated Cuts** | 20-25 (rapid fire gifts 1-11, slow reveal gift 12) |

---

## SHOOTING TIPS (Do this NOW on the floor)

1. Shoot the kid's REAL reactions — don't rehearse, let him be surprised
2. Speed up gifts 1-11 in editing (1-2 seconds each, rapid cuts)
3. SLOW DOWN gift 12 — build the pause, let the reveal breathe
4. Kid's face = the content — keep camera on his expressions
5. The features he says can be coached — whisper them to him before each gift if needed
6. The final ride across the store — let him ride freely, capture genuine joy

---

## EDITING STYLE

- **Gifts 1-11:** RAPID fire cuts, 1.5 sec each, beat-matched to music
- **Gift 12:** Slow motion reveal, 5-6 seconds of pure reaction
- **Music:** Upbeat → dramatic pause at gift 12 → explosion of energy

---

## CAMERA SETUP (iPhone 15 Pro Max)

- Handheld, close to kid's face for reactions
- One wide shot for the Flex CR reveal
- Vertical 9:16

---

## CAPTION

---

## WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL

1. **KID REACTIONS = GOLD:** Parents share, kids tag friends, everyone melts.
2. **COUNTDOWN FORMAT:** Keeps viewer watching (what's gift 12?!).
3. **EACH GIFT = A PRODUCT FEATURE:** 12 features learned without feeling like an ad.
4. **"SHOW THIS TO YOUR PARENTS" CTA:** Kids will literally forward this to amma/appa.
5. **REAL FAN, REAL STORE, REAL REACTION:** Authenticity beats production.
6. **88% of BCH customers say "saw you online"** — this kid IS that stat, living proof.
