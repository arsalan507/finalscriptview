## NOTES
- BCH Batch 4 has hooks done but NO shoot plan yet — generate before shoot day
- Viral Scripts (V1-V10) have detailed shot-by-shot breakdowns in the source files already — hooks + plans still needed
- Parent Viral (PT1-PT10) have shot-by-shot in source — hooks + plans still needed
- Appa, Please! series should be shot in episode order for continuity (same wardrobe, location progression)
- 2XG scripts are Hindi, separate from BCH Kannada content — different shoot schedule
