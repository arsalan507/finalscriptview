## SECTION 14: ASSESSMENT

```
WHY THIS WILL WORK:

1. HOOK MASTERY:
   - "Friend got Doodle" directly triggers FOMO

   - Kannada = audience connection

2. TG ALIGNMENT:

   - Parents want to make kids happy
   - Shows realistic convincing journey

3. MAGIC MOMENT INCLUSION:
   - Test ride scene = 80% conversion moment
   - Throttle excitement is authentic

4. SHAREABILITY:
   - Kids tag friends
   - Parents share with other parents
   - Emotional enough to save

5. CTA NATURAL:
   - Doesn't break story
   - BCH shown as the solution
```

```
WHAT TO WATCH FOR:
- If hook doesn't grab in 3 sec, test different opening text
- Test ride scene MUST show genuine excitement
- Kannada must be natural, not scripted-sounding
```

## SECTION 15: PRODUCTION NOTES

```
FILMING PRIORITY: Test ride scene (most important)

MUST-CAPTURE SHOTS:
1. Genuine sad expression (hold for 3 sec)
2. Friend's flex ride (slow-mo capable)
3. Father's expression change
4. THROTTLE MOMENT - kid's face lighting up
5. Final flex ride

AUDIO NOTES:
- Record clean Kannada dialogue
- Capture genuine reactions at test ride
- Music: Start sad, build to triumphant

EDITING NOTES:
- Hook text must appear INSTANTLY (0.0 sec)
- Slow-mo the flex moments
- Speed up boring transitions
- End on high energy

[ ] Kid content

VIRAL FACTORS:
1. Underdog story = universal appeal
2. Sacrifice narrative = emotional resonance
3. Happy ending = satisfying
4. Real story = authentic
5. Numbers hook = memorable

WHAT MAKES IT STAND OUT:
- Based on REAL BCH insight (auto drivers buying for kids)

- Shows BCH serving all income levels
```

## SECTION 13: TARGET AUDIENCE SIGNALS

```
PRIMARY TARGET:
- All parents (empathy)
- Lower-middle income (direct relatability)

2. EMOTIONAL POWER:
   - Sacrifice narrative is universal
   - Parent-child love transcends demographics

3. SHAREABILITY:
   - Emotional content gets shared
   - "You have to see this" factor

4. BRAND POSITIONING:
   - BCH = dream enabler, not just store
   - EMI = inclusive, not just for rich

5. COUNTER-INTUITION:
   - Surprises people (low income, high purchase)
   - Memorable because unexpected

EXECUTION CRITICAL:
