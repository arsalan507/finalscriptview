undeniable logic.

4. EMI REFRAME: ₹999/month or ₹33/day sounds way less scary than
₹56,000.

over mouth. Behind her: kid on e-cycle zooming past (motion blur). She looks
like she’s seen a ghost.
AUDIO: Screech sound + Mother’s gasp + dramatic music sting
SETUP [0:03-0:15]
(CUT TO: BCH store. Afamily enters — Teen Boy 1 as Dad (relaxed), Teen
Boy 2 as Kid (excited), and Syed Bhai narrating as we see the “Mom” through
voice-over and reactions.)
(Since we have 2 teen boys + Syed Bhai, one teen boy plays the kid, Syed Bhai
plays himself, and we use VOICE-OVER + back-of-head shots for the mother
character, OR Syed Bhai mimics the mother’s dialogue in comedy style.)
SYED BHAI (narrating to camera): “Amma-Appa maga hathira BCH ge
bandru. Appa ready. Maga ready. Aadre Amma…” (Mom-Dad came with son
to BCH. Dad ready. Son ready. But Mom…)
(CUT TO: Mom’s voice — off-screen or Syed Bhai mimicking in high-pitched
voice)

AMMA (V.O.): “E-CYCLE?! 25 KMPH?! Nanna maga ge yenu aadru?!
Traffic nalli yenu aadru?! BEDA BEDA BEDA!” (E-CYCLE?! 25 KMPH?!
What if something happens to my son?! In traffic?! NO NO NO!)
KID: “Amma… please…” [Defeated, he’s heard this 100 times]
DAD: “Bidi… Amma ge convince maadoke Syed Bhai ge bidona…” (Leave it…
let’s let Syed Bhai convince Mom…)

SYED BHAI: “Amma… ondu nimsha. Neevu walking speed eshtu goththa?”
(Mom… one minute. Do you know what walking speed is?)
AMMA (V.O.): “Walking speed? 4-5 kmph…”
SYED BHAI: “Correct! Brisk walk = 7 kmph. Iga nodri…” (Correct! Brisk
walk = 7 kmph. Now watch…)
(Syed Bhai pulls out the Aoki Flex CR. Shows the SPEED LOCK feature on the
display.)
SYED BHAI: “Aoki Flex CR nalli SPEED LOCK ide. Neevu phone nalli set
maadbahudu — MAX 10 kmph, 15 kmph, or 20 kmph. AMMA CONTROL
NALLI IRUTHTHE!” (Aoki Flex CR has SPEED LOCK. You can set from
phone — MAX 10 kmph, 15 kmph, or 20 kmph. MAMA IS IN CONTROL!)
(Shows phone screen with speed lock setting)
SYED BHAI: “15 kmph set maadi — idu Amma neevu brisk walk maadidre
DOUBLE ashte. Scooter 60 kmph. Car 40 kmph. Idu 15 kmph. Yaarddu safe?”
(Set 15 kmph — this is just DOUBLE your brisk walk. Scooter is 60 kmph. Car
is 40 kmph. This is 15 kmph. Which is safer?)
(Pulls out FREE helmet)
SYED BHAI: “Plus — helmet FREE. Knee guards FREE. Elbow pads FREE.
15 accessories nalli safety kit full ide!” (Plus — helmet FREE. Knee guards
FREE. Elbow pads FREE. Ful l safety kit in 15 accessories!)
CLIMAX + BRAND [0:35-0:50]
(Amma’s voice changes from panic to interest)
AMMA (V.O.): “Speed lock ide na? Naanu control maadbahudu na?”
(There’s speed lock? Ican control it?)

SYED BHAI: “Amma… neevu bedroom nalli kuthkondu phone nalli maga
speed control maadbahudu. Maga jaasthi speed maadakke try maadidre —
cycle BLOCK aagutte!” (Mom… you can sit in bedroom and control son ’s speed
from phone. If son tries to go faster — cycle BLOCKS!)
AMMA (V.O.): “Hmm… adu safe ide actually…” (Hmm… that’s actual ly
safe…)
(Kid puts on helmet. Ful l safety gear. Sits on Aoki Flex CR.)
