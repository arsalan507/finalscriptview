| Language | Street Kannada |
| Hook Type | School status reveal + Jealousy drama |
| Target Audience | Kids 14-17 — social status, being the cool kid, peer FOMO |
| Objection Attacked | "Just a cycle / Nobody will care / Friends will make fun" |
| Product | Aoki Flex CR |

## Crew Assignments
| Role | Actor | Reason | Alternative |
|---|---|---|---|
| Syed Bhai (himself) | Syed | Director + BCH closer, appears at store and mysteriously at school end | — |
| Kid 1 (Uncool/Existing Kid) | Sanjay | Enthusiastic, can play the underdog → FOMO → desperate buyer arc convincingly | Baba |
| New Cool Kid | Appi | Agile, lean, fit — perfect for slow-mo cool entrance on cycle, action-oriented | Sami |
| Extra Kids (crowd) | 5-6 Local Kids | Selfie crowd, lunch table joiners, test ride line, phone-calling-parents ending | — |

**Note:** Appi's physical agility and lean look make him the ideal "cool new kid" for the slow-mo entrance. The way he moves will sell the confident character. Sanjay plays the relatable underdog everyone roots for — his enthusiasm translates into the desperate "Appa PLEASE!" energy.

### Talent Notes
- **Sami** has the heaviest load in this batch — 4 scripts including a costume role (Ajji). Schedule his energy-heavy scenes (Gamer Kid transformation, Ajji costume) with breaks in between.
- **Appi** only needed for Script 20 school gate scenes — call him for Block 3 only. Short but high-impact role.
- **Local Kids** needed for 3 scripts (group rides + school crowd). Coordinate with parents for Block 3 and Block 4 availability.
- **Baba** appears in 3 scripts as different fathers — wardrobe changes between each. Keep costume changes simple: different shirt each time.
- **Sanjay** plays both a father (Script 17) and a teen kid (Script 20) — wardrobe contrast essential. Father = mature look, Kid 1 = basic/simple clothes.
