# BCH PATTERN INTERRUPT HOOKS
## 98% Scroll-Stop Hooks | First 3 Seconds Only

**What is a Pattern Interrupt?**
A visual/audio element that BREAKS the viewer's expected scroll experience. Their brain says "wait, that's not normal" and forces them to stop and process.

**Pattern Interrupt Types:**
1. **PHYSICAL SHOCK** — Unexpected action (throwing, breaking, falling)
2. **EMOTIONAL BREAK** — Unexpected emotion (father crying, kid serious)
3. **VISUAL CONFUSION** — Something in wrong place/context
4. **AUDIO JARRING** — Silence→Loud or Loud→Silence
5. **DIRECT CONFRONTATION** — Staring at camera, accusing viewer
6. **MOTION BREAK** — Sudden freeze, slow-mo, or speed change

# SHOCK MOTION + FACE CLOSE-UP HOOKS
## The Most Powerful Pattern Interrupt Combination

**Formula:** EMOTIONAL FACE CLOSE-UP + SUDDEN MOTION + REACTION

This is the "nuclear option" — combines primal face recognition with unexpected motion.

**[0:00-0:01]**
```

Shows "NO SERVICE AVAILABLE" on screen.

FACE: Father doesn't flinch. Dead eyes. Defeated.
```

**[0:01-0:02]**
```

```

```

### VIDEOGRAPHER: FACE CLOSE-UP
```
FRAMING:
- Face fills 90% of frame
- Eyes at upper third line
- Nose to forehead only (no chin initially)
- Slow zoom to JUST the eyes

EMOTION COACHING:
- Tell actor: "Your child is sick, no doctor will answer"
- Or: "Think of your biggest frustration in life"
- REAL emotion reads better than acting

MOTION ELEMENT:
- Phone thrown by assistant from off-camera
- Enters frame at eye level
- Stops just before hitting face (controlled throw)
- Actor should NOT react (dead, defeated energy)
```
