### HOOK [0:00-0:03]
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "WIFE PERMISSION SLIP NEEDED? DO THIS MATH FIRST"
**VISUAL:** RAVI holding calculator, defeated face, looking at camera
**AUDIO:** Calculator button sounds → silence

### SETUP [0:03-0:12]
KIRAN: "Machha, Cadence togondiya?" (Bro, did you buy the Cadence?)

RAVI: [sighs] "Wife koochna hai bro... ₹57,000 anta kelsidre she'll kill me."
(Need to ask wife bro... if she hears ₹57,000 she'll kill me.)

KIRAN: [pulls out calculator] "Okay, let's do wife math."

### STORY ARC [0:12-0:30]
KIRAN: [typing on calculator] "Your Swiggy per month?"

RAVI: "₹4,000 irbodhu..." (Maybe ₹4,000...)

KIRAN: "Your chai-cigarette?"

RAVI: "₹3,000..."

KIRAN: "Weekend drinks?"

RAVI: [uncomfortable] "...₹5,000"

KIRAN: [shows calculator] "₹12,000 per month. ₹1,44,000 per year. You're spending TWO AND A HALF Cadences per year on KILLING yourself."

[RAVI stares at calculator, jaw drops]

KIRAN: "But ₹2,499 EMI for your HEALTH... wife permission beku?"
(But ₹2,499 EMI for your health... you need wife's permission?)

### CLIMAX + BRAND [0:30-0:40]

- Key shots: Calculator close-up showing ₹1,44,000, RAVI's face reaction, Cadence beauty shot
- Estimated cuts: 8-10

### WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL
1. **Every married man** has hidden monthly expenses he doesn't want wife to see
2. **Calculator reveal** is a pattern interrupt - viewer does the math with you
3. **Dark humor flip** - "you spend more on killing yourself" hits hard
4. **Wife becomes the hero** at the end (not the villain)
5. **Caption CTA:** "Share with that friend jo 'wife ko poochna hai' bolta hai"

KIRAN: "Togolappa! Just buy it!" (Just buy it!)

RAVI: "Wait wait... wife ge call maadi kelbeku..." (I need to call wife and ask...)

[PHONE RINGS - RAVI freezes]

(Yeah babe... I'm near the store...)

[We only hear RAVI's side]

RAVI: "Hmm... hmm... WHAT?... Really?... You sure?..."

[RAVI's face goes from FEAR → CONFUSION → SHOCK → DISBELIEF]

KIRAN: [whispering] "Yen aythu?" (What happened?)

RAVI: [puts phone down, stares at KIRAN]

### CLIMAX + BRAND [0:35-0:48]
RAVI: "Bro... she said... her friend's husband bought AOKI Cadence last week..."

KIRAN: "And?"

- Key shots: RAVI's face changing emotions during call, phone close-up, Cadence beauty shot
- Estimated cuts: 10-12
- IMPORTANT: Wife is NEVER shown, only heard through RAVI's reactions

### WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL
1. **THE TWIST** - Wife isn't angry about buying, she's angry he HASN'T bought
2. **FOMO through wife** - Her friend's husband already bought one
3. **Every husband** has felt that phone-ring fear
4. **Wife = hero** not blocker (wives watching will love this)

[Camera zooms into paper]
**PAPER READS:** "I, [Wife's name], hereby give permission to my husband to purchase one (1) e-cycle not exceeding ₹40,000. Signed: [signature]"

RAVI: "Bro you don't understand married life..."

KIRAN: "I AM married! I just bought the Cadence. You know what my wife said?"

RAVI: "What?"

KIRAN: "'Finally you're doing something about that belly.' THAT'S what she said."

[RAVI looks down at his own belly]

KIRAN: "My cycle has a hidden motor. A hidden battery. A hidden display. It's the AOKI Cadence."

[Camera pans to reveal Cadence]

"Nobody... NOBODY has figured it out. My neighbor cycles with me daily - he has NO idea."

"My mother-in-law told my wife 'your husband is so hardworking, 10 KM cycling!'

"My boss gave me a 'healthy employee' award last month."

[Looks at camera]

"I pedal for 7 KM. Motor helps for 3. But the RESULT? I actually lost 6 KG. My stamina IS better. The cycling IS real. The motor just... makes sure I don't QUIT."

### CLIMAX + BRAND [0:25-0:38]
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "AOKI CADENCE | The secret everyone should have | ₹56,999"

KIRAN: "This is the only secret I'll ever recommend. European design that looks like a road bike. Battery INSIDE the frame. Display you can barely see."

"You get fit. You get respect. And nobody judges you for needing a little help."

"Because guess what? At 30+... we ALL need a little help."

### CTA [0:38-0:45]
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "24-Hour Test Ride | Just ₹499"

KIRAN: "₹499 test ride. 24 hours. Your secret starts here."

"Share this with your friend who needs this secret."

**END CARD:** BCH logo + phone number

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- Characters: KIRAN only (confessional style, direct to camera)
- Props: Cadence
- Key shots: Confessional face, Cadence hidden features close-up, slow pan of cycle design
- Estimated cuts: 6-8
- TONE: More serious/genuine than other scripts

### WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL
1. **"I've been lying"** confession hook = massive curiosity
2. **Every benefit proven through STORY** not specs
3. **"Motor makes sure I don't quit"** - this is THE insight for Grey TG
4. **Mother-in-law impressed** = married man's dream
5. **"We ALL need a little help at 30+"** is universally relatable

| Formula Used | The Parallel Lives Reveal (v7) |
| Duration | 40-50 seconds |
| Platform | Instagram Reel |
| Language | Kannada-English mix |
| Hook Type | Deja vu confrontation |
| Objection Attacked | "I'll buy later / not now" |

### HOOK [0:00-0:03]
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "SAME FRIEND. SAME SPOT. SAME EXCUSE. 365 DAYS LATER."
**VISUAL:** RAVI standing outside BCH, KIRAN arriving on Cadence, shaking head
**AUDIO:** Calendar page flip sound

### SETUP [0:03-0:12]
KIRAN: [gets off Cadence, walks up to RAVI] "Machha... you're here AGAIN?"

RAVI: "Yeah, thought I'd check out the Cadence again."

KIRAN: "Again. You said this LAST February."

RAVI: "..."

KIRAN: "And last March. And last June. And in October you said 'Diwali ke baad.' It's FEBRUARY again."

### STORY ARC [0:12-0:30]
KIRAN: "In 365 days... you know what I did on the Cadence?"

[Pulls out phone, shows stats/photos]

"2,400 KM total. 8 KG lost. BP normal now. Doctor said 'whatever you're doing, keep doing it.'"

"And you?"

RAVI: [uncomfortable] "I've been meaning to..."

KIRAN: "Meaning to. Planning to. Going to. ABOUT to."

"Bro... 'LATER' is the most expensive word in your vocabulary. You know why?"

RAVI: "Why?"

KIRAN: "Because every month you said 'later,' your body said 'older.' Your belly said 'bigger.' Your BP said 'higher.' 'Later' cost you 365 DAYS of health."

### CLIMAX + BRAND [0:30-0:42]
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "365 days of 'LATER' = 365 days LOST"

KIRAN: "AOKI Cadence is still ₹56,999. Same price as last year. But YOU are not the same. You're one year WORSE."

[Points to Cadence]

"₹2,499 per month. The price hasn't changed. But your body's price is going UP."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "AOKI CADENCE | Same price. Your health isn't."

### CTA [0:42-0:50]
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "24-Hour Test Ride | Just ₹499 | Don't wait another 365 days"

KIRAN: "₹499 test ride. Right now. Not tomorrow. Not Diwali ke baad. NOW."

RAVI: [long pause, then] "...Book it."

KIRAN: "Finally. Only took 365 days."

**END CARD:** BCH logo + phone number

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- Characters: RAVI + KIRAN
- Props: Cadence, phone showing stats
- Key shots: Calendar flip effect (editor can add), RAVI's guilt face, Cadence
- Estimated cuts: 10-12

### WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL
1. **"365 Days Same Spot"** visual = devastating realization
2. **Every viewer** knows someone (or IS someone) who says "later"
3. **"'Later' is the most expensive word"** is quotable
4. **Progress vs no progress** comparison is dark and powerful
5. **"Your body's price is going UP"** is a line that HAUNTS

## SCRIPT 20: "THE LAST EXCUSE"

| Attribute | Value |

**AUDIO:** Dark, slow music

[Outside BCH, KIRAN turns to camera]

KIRAN: "My friend RAVI has been making excuses for 1 year. Today... we end it."

[Camera reveals RAVI with POST-IT NOTES stuck all over him, each with an excuse]

"Let's read them."

### STORY ARC [0:12-0:40]
[KIRAN peels off each excuse, reads it, crumples it, throws it]

KIRAN: [Peels #1] "'Too expensive.' ₹2,499 EMI. Less than Swiggy." [CRUMPLE, THROW]

[Peels #2] "'Wife won't allow.' Wife already wants one." [CRUMPLE, THROW]

[Peels #3] "'I'm fit.' Can't see his toes." [CRUMPLE, THROW]

[Peels #4] "'Electric is cheating.' He takes AUTO to work." [CRUMPLE, THROW]

[Peels #5] "'I'll buy later.' Said that 365 days ago." [CRUMPLE, THROW]

[Peels #6] "'Not real cycling.' Has a GYM CARD he never uses." [CRUMPLE, THROW]

[Peels #7] "'People will judge.' NOBODY can tell it's electric." [CRUMPLE, THROW]

[Last one on RAVI's chest]

KIRAN: [peels the LAST one, reads it]

"'I'm scared to start.'"

[Pause. KIRAN doesn't crumple this one.]

### CLIMAX + BRAND [0:40-0:52]
KIRAN: [softer tone] "Machha... this one's real. Everyone's scared to start something new at 30. At 35. At 40."

"But AOKI Cadence is built for people who are scared to start. Motor helps you when you're tired. You pedal at YOUR pace. No one's judging. No one even knows it's electric."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "AOKI CADENCE | Built for people brave enough to START | ₹56,999"

"₹499 test ride. Just TRY. That's all. You don't have to commit. Just try."

### CTA [0:52-0:60]
[RAVI, now free of all papers, stands next to Cadence]

RAVI: [quietly] "Book it."

KIRAN: [smiles] "No more excuses?"

RAVI: "No more excuses."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "24-Hour Test Ride | Just ₹499 | Your excuses are over"
**END CARD:** BCH logo + phone number + "Bharath Cycle Hub, Yelahanka"

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- Characters: RAVI + KIRAN
- Props: **POST-IT NOTES** with excuses written in marker (7 notes, each readable on camera), Cadence
- Key shots: Each excuse being peeled and crumpled (7 rapid moments), last excuse emotional pause, Cadence
- Estimated cuts: 15-18
- **BUY:** Large post-it notes and thick markers
- TONE: Starts dark/funny, ends genuinely emotional

### WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL
1. **Visual metaphor** of excuses stuck on a person = INSTANTLY shareable
2. **Compilation of ALL objections** = every viewer sees THEIR excuse
3. **The "scared to start" moment** - unexpected vulnerability after dark humor
4. **Perfect FINAL script** - ties the entire 20-video series together
5. **"Built for people brave enough to START"** is a BRAND LINE BCH should use everywhere
