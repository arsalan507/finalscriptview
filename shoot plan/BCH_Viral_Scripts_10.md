# SCRIPT 1: "APPA, NANNA FRIENDS ELLA HOGTHARE..."
## (Dad, All My Friends Are Going...)

### Formula: LIFE PATH CONTRAST | CTA: DIRECT | Duration: 45-55 sec

### Viral Mechanics Applied:
- **Hook:** Emotional text overlay + kid's sad face (Twisted Sagar V15 - Father's Dream pattern)
- **Share Trigger:** Parent-to-parent sharing ("Every parent will relate to this")
- **Emotional Peak:** 25-35 sec mark - Father's face change from hesitation to decision
- **Purchase Trigger:** Birthday deadline + Social status fear

---

### SHOT-BY-SHOT BREAKDOWN:

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK - Text + Visual**

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT (Persistent):** "NANNA MAGA HEGE FEEL AAGTHIDDA ANTHA GOTTIRLILLA 💔"
> *(I didn't know how my son was feeling)*

- **VISUAL:** Close-up of a father's face looking at his phone (scrolling BCH Instagram). Slight guilt expression.
- **AUDIO:** Soft emotional Kannada background score. No dialogue yet.
- **WHY THIS WORKS:** Opens with parental guilt - the #1 hidden emotion (from BCH data: "Their way of saying 'I love you my kid'"). Text is in Kannada = instant local connection.

---

**[0:03-0:08] SETUP - The Problem**

> **FATHER (Voice-over, casual Kannada):**
> "Nanna maga 3 months inda kelthidda - 'Appa, nanna friends ella e-cycle mele school ge hogthare, naanu mathra bus nalli hogthini'..."

*(My son was asking for 3 months - "Dad, all my friends go to school on e-cycles, only I go by bus...")*

- **VISUAL:** Wide shot of BCH store exterior. Father walking toward the store, slightly hesitant.
- **AUDIO:** Father's voice - real, authentic, not scripted-sounding. Street Kannada.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** "Friend comparison" = #1 kid trigger (BCH data: FOMO confirmed as daily trigger). Parents hearing this from another parent creates instant relatability.

---

**[0:08-0:15] BUILD - The Hesitation**

> **FATHER (continuing):**
> "Naanu yochne maadthidde - Rs.25,000 cycle ge? Adu beda, idu beda... aamele use maadalla andre? Wife heltaale 'naanu heldidde' antha..."

*(I was thinking - Rs.25,000 for a cycle? This won't work, that won't work... what if he stops using it? Wife will say 'I told you so'...)*

- **VISUAL:** Father inside BCH store, looking at cycles but not touching. Staff in background (natural, not posed). Camera follows him from behind.
- **AUDIO:** His internal conflict is audible. Voice slightly lower, uncertain.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** Addresses the REAL parent fear (BCH data: "Wasting money, then spouse saying 'I told you so'" + "Where will kid ride, will he use 40KM range?"). Every parent watching thinks "THIS IS ME."

---

**[0:15-0:25] THE CONTRAST - Before vs After**

> **FATHER:**
> "Aadre ond dina nanna maga ne heldha - 'Appa, Rahul ge birthday ge Doodle sigithu, avnu daily school ge ride maadthane. Naanu yavaaga appa?'"

*(But one day my son said - "Dad, Rahul got a Doodle for his birthday, he rides to school daily. When will I get one, dad?")*

- **VISUAL:** Cut to BCH store - a kid's face lighting up during test ride (real customer footage if possible). The E-cycle throttle being twisted. Speed picking up. Kid smiling wide.
- **AUDIO:** Father's voice cracks slightly. Background music builds. Sound of e-cycle motor humming.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** "Birthday deadline + Social proof" = THE #1 psychological trigger (BCH data). The friend comparison creates FOMO in both the kid AND the watching parent's kid.

---

**[0:25-0:35] PEAK EMOTIONAL MOMENT - The Decision**

> **FATHER:**
> "Adu EMotorad X1 - Rs.25,000. EMI Rs.999 per month. Naanu yochne maadthidde Rs.56,000 Doodle beku antha - aadre X1 alli same electric power ide, same 25 kmph speed ide, same throttle ide."

*(It's the EMotorad X1 - Rs.25,000. EMI Rs.999/month. I was thinking I need the Rs.56,000 Doodle - but X1 has the same electric power, same 25 kmph speed, same throttle.)*

- **VISUAL:** Father's hand on the X1 cycle. Staff showing features. Cut to the price tag clearly visible. Then cut to the EMI breakdown on a board/screen.
- **AUDIO:** Confident now. Music shifts from emotional to uplifting. The "click" moment.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** SPECIFIC PRICING (BCH Principle #3: "Rs.15K electric cycle = Memorable, Under budget = Forgettable"). Mentions Rs.999 EMI - the exact hook that got massive attention in BCH's past content.

---

**[0:35-0:45] RESOLUTION + TRANSFORMATION**

> **FATHER:**
> "Innu best part - BCH 15 free accessories kodthare, 2 year warranty, free helmet, speed lock feature ide... nanna wife kooda 'nice decision' antha heldlu."

*(Best part - BCH gives 15 free accessories, 2 year warranty, free helmet, speed lock feature... even my wife said 'nice decision.')*

- **VISUAL:** Kid riding the X1 outside the store. Huge smile. Father watching proudly. Staff waving. Cut to accessories being handed over.
- **AUDIO:** Triumphant. Father's voice is now proud and certain. Kid's laughter in background.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** Overcomes EVERY parent objection in 10 seconds: Price (EMI), Safety (helmet + speed lock), Service (warranty), Wife approval (social validation). Mother's fear addressed: speed lock = "I'm not a bad mother."

---

**[0:45-0:55] CTA - DIRECT**

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
> **"EMotorad X1 - Rs.25,000 | EMI Rs.999/month"**
> **"BCH Yelahanka | Call: 9380097119"**
> **"15 FREE Accessories + FREE Helmet + 2 Year Warranty"**

> **FATHER (to camera):**
> "Nimma maga kooda kelthiddare, tadeya maadbedi. BCH Yelahanka ge banni, ond test ride kodisi. Maga smile maadidre, decision automatic."

*(If your son is also asking, don't delay. Come to BCH Yelahanka, give one test ride. If the son smiles, decision is automatic.)*

- **VISUAL:** Father and son together at store. Phone numbers large on screen. Store address visible.
- **AUDIO:** Direct, warm, father-to-father tone.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** "Test ride = Magic moment" (BCH data: "Excitement of throttle, pedal assist magic, kids get fired up"). Plants the seed: "Just come for a test ride" = low commitment ask that converts at 88%.

---

### WHY THIS SCRIPT WILL GO VIRAL:
1. **Shareability:** Parents will forward to spouse - "See, even he was confused like us"
2. **Save trigger:** Specific price + EMI = bookmark for later purchase
3. **FOMO creation:** "Rahul got Doodle" will make watching kids bug their parents
4. **Objection elimination:** Safety, price, wife approval - all handled in 55 seconds
5. **7-day window activation:** Creates urgency without fake scarcity

---
---

# SCRIPT 2: "Rs.999 GE E-CYCLE? HEGE POSSIBLE?"
## (E-Cycle for Rs.999? How Is That Possible?)

- **VISUAL:** Someone's hand holding Rs.999 cash (two 500-rupee notes). Camera slowly pans up to reveal a shiny EMotorad e-cycle at BCH store.
- **AUDIO:** Record scratch sound effect. Then silence for 1 second.
- **WHY THIS WORKS:** Rs.999 = pattern interrupt. Brain says "impossible." Curiosity forces them to keep watching. BCH data confirms: "We promoted Rs.999 EMI scheme - got a LOT of attention."

---

**[0:03-0:10] SETUP - The Reality**

> **BCH STAFF/FOUNDER (casual Kannada, to camera):**
> "Helu, Rs.999 per month EMI alli nimma magange electric cycle kodbahudu. Joke alla, real deal. Illi nodri..."

*(Listen, you can give your kid an electric cycle at Rs.999 per month EMI. Not a joke, real deal. Look here...)*

- **VISUAL:** Staff member standing next to the EMotorad X1. Points to the cycle, then to a clearly written EMI breakdown board.
- **AUDIO:** Excited, street Kannada. Fast-paced but clear.

---

**[0:10-0:20] BUILD - The Breakdown**

> **STAFF:**
> "EMotorad X1 - Rs.25,000. EMI: Rs.999/month. Yaavde credit card, yaavde finance. 25 kmph speed, throttle, pedal assist - electric cycle adu, normal cycle alla."

*(EMotorad X1 - Rs.25,000. EMI: Rs.999/month. Any credit card, any finance. 25 kmph speed, throttle, pedal assist - it's an electric cycle, not a normal one.)*

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT (appears as he speaks each point):**
> - Rs.999/month EMI
> - 25 kmph Speed
> - Throttle + Pedal Assist
> - 40 KM Range

- **VISUAL:** Quick cuts showing each feature. Throttle being twisted. Speedometer hitting 25. Pedal assist levels being switched. Battery indicator.
- **AUDIO:** Each feature accompanied by a subtle "ding" sound. Energy building.

---

**[0:20-0:30] EMOTIONAL PEAK - The Story**

> **STAFF:**
> "Naavu illi ondhu auto driver ge EMI mele e-cycle kodidvi. Avru heldru - 'nanna maga school ge auto nalli hogthidda, innu cycle mele hogthane. Adu nanna maga ge naanu kotta first gift.' Appa iro love ge budget barrier illa guru."

*(We gave an auto driver an e-cycle on EMI here. He said - "My son used to go to school by auto, now he goes by cycle. This is the first gift I gave my son." A father's love has no budget barrier, guru.)*

- **VISUAL:** Emotional moment. If available - real footage of the auto driver story. If not - staff telling the story with genuine emotion, cut to a kid riding happily.
- **AUDIO:** Background music shifts to emotional. Staff's voice softens. Real emotion.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** The auto-rickshaw driver story is REAL BCH data (founder was amazed by it). This is the "unexpected customer" story that creates massive emotional resonance. Parents earning less think "If he can do it, I can too." Parents earning more think "I have no excuse."

---

**[0:30-0:40] CONTRAST + CTA**

> **STAFF:**
> "Iga yochne maadri - Rs.999 monthly... adhe budget alli nimma maga phone game aadthane, screen munde kuthkondirthane. Athva Rs.999 alli avnige freedom kodi, health kodi, social status kodi."

*(Now think - Rs.999 monthly... in that same budget your son plays phone games, sits in front of screen. Or for Rs.999, give him freedom, health, social status.)*

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT (Final Frame):**
> **"EMotorad X1 - EMI Rs.999/month"**
> **"BCH Yelahanka | 9380097119 | 7996994427"**

*(Come to BCH Yelahanka, test ride is free. If son smiles, deal done.)*

- **VISUAL:** Split screen - Left: kid on phone (boring, dull). Right: kid on e-cycle (happy, moving, free). Then store exterior + phone numbers.
- **AUDIO:** Confident close. Music upbeat.

---

- **VISUAL:** Kid on test ride. Throttle twist. Speed picking up. Wind in hair. GENUINE smile. Cut to: Same kid riding to school (2nd day footage feel). Cut to: 3-month later feel - kid with friends, all on cycles.
- **AUDIO:** Father's voice - proud, emotional but not crying (BCH data: parents don't cry, they feel joy and pride). Background music builds to emotional peak.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** Addresses the 3-month drop fear ("3 months aaythu, innoo ride maadthane") and the Gold 20% reality. Shows the BEST case scenario = aspiration for parents.

---

**[0:35-0:45] THE FATHER'S MOMENT**

> *(How many hours a day does your son watch the phone?)*

- **VISUAL:** Close-up of a kid's face, blue screen light reflecting. Eyes glazed. Slouched posture. Dark room.

---

**[0:03-0:12] SETUP - The Consequences (Fear Build)**

*(Addiction. Eyesight damage. Social isolation. Your son is locked in a room, doesn't play with friends, doesn't go out, no exercise. Doctors say screen time in Indian kids has increased 300%.)*

- **VISUAL:** Quick cuts (Twisted Sagar style): Kid on phone in bed. Kid with glasses (eyesight). Kid alone while friends play outside. An eye strain image. Each cut = 1.5 seconds.
- **AUDIO:** Authoritative voice. Medical-style urgency. Each consequence hits like a punch. No music - just voice and silence.

- **AUDIO:** Bright, energetic music kicks in. Complete mood shift. Kids' voices, wind, cycle sounds.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** "PlayStation vs E-cycle pitch" that BCH founder actually used: "Why buy PlayStation, buy electric cycle at same budget." This script scales that exact pitch to thousands of parents.

---

**[0:25-0:40] THE PROOF - Real Customer Evidence**

> **REAL PARENT (at BCH store, casual):**
> "Nanna maga 4 hours daily phone aadthidda. E-cycle kotte. First week avne heldha - 'Amma, phone boring, ride hogona.' 6 months aaythu, avnu Gold customer - daily school ge ride maadthane, servicing ge barthane. Eyesight improve aaythu, weight loss aaythu."

> **"9380097119 | 7996994427"**
> **"EMotorad X1 Rs.25K | Trex Air Rs.35K | Doodle Rs.56K"**

*(Make one phone call. Or come directly. We've built trust for 25 years - one visit will clear your doubts.)*

---

### WHY THIS SCRIPT WILL GO VIRAL:
1. **Addresses the UNSPOKEN fear** that stops 30% of e-cycle purchases
2. **Trust > Creative brilliance** (BCH Principle #1)
3. **Founder's face = authority** (YouTube creates "perception of strong authority")
4. **Numbers create believability** - 25 years, 1500 families, 60% market share
5. **Low-friction CTA** - "One phone call or direct visit" + "One visit will clear doubts"

# SCRIPT 6: "ADU WASTE AAGALLA - GUARANTEE"
## (It Won't Be Wasted - Guarantee)

### Formula: CONSEQUENCE CINEMA | CTA: DIRECT | Duration: 45-55 sec

### Viral Mechanics Applied:
- **Hook:** The biggest unspoken parent fear (Twisted Sagar V4 - Education changes pattern)
- **Share Trigger:** Parents who relate to "wasted expensive gift" anxiety
- **Emotional Peak:** Gold 20% customer proof
- **Purchase Trigger:** Usage guarantee + multiple user reframe

---

### SHOT-BY-SHOT BREAKDOWN:

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK**

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:** "3 MONTHS ALLI USE MAADODU NILLISIDRE? 💰"
> *(What if they stop using it in 3 months?)*

- **VISUAL:** A dusty cycle in a corner of a house. Cobwebs. Unused. A parent looking at it with disappointment.
- **AUDIO:** Heavy sigh. Silence.
- **WHY THIS WORKS:** "Will kid actually ride it?" is objection #5 (BCH data). "Wave of excitement drops 60-80% after 3 months" is the REAL data. This hook says what every parent is secretly thinking.

---

**[0:03-0:12] ACKNOWLEDGE THE FEAR**

> **FOUNDER (honest, direct):**
> "Naanu BCH founder. Honest aagi heltini - 70% kids, 3 months aadmele ride kammi maadthare. Idu nija. Naanu deny maadalla."

*(I'm the BCH founder. I'll be honest - 70% of kids, after 3 months, reduce riding. This is true. I won't deny it.)*

- **VISUAL:** Founder at store. Sincere face. No hype. This is radical honesty.
- **AUDIO:** Calm, honest tone. Zero sales energy.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** RADICAL HONESTY = viral shareability. No other cycle store admits this. "He's being real" = trust explosion.

---

**[0:12-0:25] THE REFRAME**

> **FOUNDER:**
> "Aadre idu yochne maadri... nimma maga 3 months daily ride maadthane - school ge, tuition ge, friends mane ge. Adu alone Rs.25,000 worth experience. Aadre innoo 3 things idhe."

*(But think about this... your son rides daily for 3 months - to school, tuition, friends' houses. That alone is Rs.25,000 worth of experience. But there are 3 more things.)*

> "ONE - E-cycle ge multiple users. Maga use maadidmele, appa commute ge use maadbahudu, amma shopping ge use maadbahudu. Ond vehicle, full family."

*(ONE - E-cycle has multiple users. After son uses, dad can use for commute, mom can use for shopping. One vehicle, full family.)*

> "TWO - Gold 20%. 20% kids daily commute ge use maadthare 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. Adhu yaake? Parents support kottare, school ge ride maadoke encourage maadidare."

*(TWO - Gold 20%. 20% of kids use it for daily commute - 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. Why? If parents support and encourage riding to school.)*

> "THREE - 2 years aadmele, exchange option ide. New model ge upgrade maadbahudu. Athva sell maadbahudu - e-cycles ge resale value ide."

*(THREE - After 2 years, there's an exchange option. Upgrade to a new model. Or sell - e-cycles have resale value.)*

- **VISUAL:** Cut to: Dad riding the cycle to nearby shop. Mom using it. Multiple family members on the same e-cycle. Then: A daily rider kid (Gold 20%) going to school confidently. Then: Exchange/upgrade visual.
- **AUDIO:** Each point builds confidence. Voice shifts from honest concern to practical solution.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** "Multiple user" reframe is BCH's actual sales counter pitch (verbatim: "We convince them saying this can be used by multiple people of different age and for different use-case"). Gold 20% is the aspiration to sell.

---

**[0:25-0:40] SOCIAL PROOF**

> **REAL PARENT (at BCH store):**
> "Naanu kooda same doubt idithu. 8 months aaythu. Nanna maga DAILY school ge ride maadthane. Avnu Gold customer - BCH ge service ge barthane. Nange ond paisaa waste aagilla."

*(I had the same doubt too. It's been 8 months. My son rides to school DAILY. He's a Gold customer - comes to BCH for service. Not one rupee wasted for me.)*

- **VISUAL:** Real parent. Real kid. Real cycle. Real BCH store background.
- **AUDIO:** Authentic. Imperfect. Believable.

---

**[0:40-0:55] CTA**

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
> **"E-Cycle: Family Vehicle, Not Just Kid's Toy"**
> **"EMotorad X1 Rs.25K | EMI Rs.999/month"**
> **"BCH Yelahanka | 9380097119"**
> **"300+ Cycles | 25 Years | 60% Market Share"**

> **FOUNDER:**
> "Waste aaguthe antha yochne maadthiddare, banni ond mathaadona. 25 years inda families jothe kelsthidini - nange gottu yaav cycle nimma family ge right antha."

*(If you're thinking it'll be wasted, come let's talk. I've been working with families for 25 years - I know which cycle is right for your family.)*

---

### WHY THIS SCRIPT WILL GO VIRAL:
1. **Radical honesty** = "70% drop off" admission creates MASSIVE trust
2. **Multiple user reframe** = Makes Rs.25K feel like family investment, not kid's toy
3. **Gold 20% aspiration** = "Your kid could be in that 20%"
4. **Real customer proof** = "8 months daily" destroys the fear
5. **Founder's personal invite** = "Come talk to me" = high trust CTA

---

# SCRIPT 7: "DOODLE YAAK BEKKU?"
## (Why Do They Want The Doodle?)

### Formula: UNEXPECTED TWIST | CTA: DIRECT | Duration: 40-50 sec

### Viral Mechanics Applied:
- **Hook:** Mystery/Curiosity (Twisted Sagar V5 - Friendship pattern: 4.24% share rate)
- **Share Trigger:** Kids tagging friends - "This is literally me"
- **Emotional Peak:** The twist reveal of WHY Doodle is the most sold
- **Purchase Trigger:** Social status aspiration + FOMO

---

### SHOT-BY-SHOT BREAKDOWN:

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK**

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:** "DOODLE Rs.56,000 - INNOO MOST SOLD CYCLE IN BCH 🤯"
> *(Doodle Rs.56,000 - Still the Most Sold Cycle in BCH)*

- **VISUAL:** BCH store. A row of Doodle cycles. One being wheeled out for a customer. "SOLD" tag visible.
- **AUDIO:** Cash register "cha-ching" sound. Surprised reaction sound.
- **WHY THIS WORKS:** "Most expensive yet most sold" is a contradiction that creates instant curiosity. Brain needs to resolve: "WHY would people pay more?"

---

**[0:03-0:10] SETUP - The Wrong Assumptions**

> **FOUNDER (walking through store):**
> "Evrybody kelthare - 'Rs.56,000 cycle ge yaaru kodthare?' Naanu heltini - Rs.25K X1 ide, Rs.35K Trex Air ide, cheap options ide... aadre Doodle MOST SOLD. Yaake?"

*(Everyone asks - "Who pays Rs.56,000 for a cycle?" I tell them - Rs.25K X1 exists, Rs.35K Trex Air exists, cheap options exist... but Doodle is MOST SOLD. Why?)*

- **VISUAL:** Founder walking past X1, past Trex Air, past budget cycles... stopping at Doodle. Camera follows.
- **AUDIO:** Curious tone. Building mystery.

---

**[0:10-0:25] BUILD - The Interview**

> **FOUNDER approaches 2-3 kids at the store:**

> **Kid 1:** "Doodle fat tyre ide, drifting maadbahudu!"
> *(Doodle has fat tyres, can do drifting!)*

> **Kid 2:** "Nanna friend ge Doodle ide, avnu school alli superstar. Nange avnantha beku."
> *(My friend has a Doodle, he's a superstar in school. I want to be like him.)*

> **Kid 3:** "X1 normal kanisththe. Doodle different, elli ninthre turn maadthare."
> *(X1 looks normal. Doodle is different, wherever you stand people turn and look.)*

- **VISUAL:** Real kids at BCH store (with permission). Natural, unscripted feel. Each kid touching/sitting on the Doodle. Genuine expressions.
- **AUDIO:** Kids' authentic voices. Street Kannada. Real excitement.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** "Social status is the biggest trigger, nothing else" (BCH founder verbatim). Kids explaining STATUS in their own words = more powerful than any ad copy.

---

**[0:25-0:35] THE TWIST - The Real Answer**

> **FOUNDER (to camera, revelation tone):**
> "Gotthaaythu? Doodle Rs.56,000 alla... Doodle SOCIAL STATUS kodsththe, adu priceless. Rich family inda auto driver family vargu, Doodle beku anthare. Yaake? Maga school alli 'THE GUY' aagbeku anthare. Cycle alla guru, idu identity."

*(Got it? Doodle isn't Rs.56,000... Doodle GIVES social status, that's priceless. From rich families to auto driver families, they want the Doodle. Why? Because the son wants to be 'THE GUY' in school. It's not a cycle guru, it's an identity.)*

- **VISUAL:** Montage of different kids on Doodles - rich neighborhood, middle-class area, simple home. All the same smile. All the same pride.
- **AUDIO:** Beat drops. Revelation music. This is the "aha" moment.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** Unexpected Twist formula - setup says "expensive product" but twist reveals "it's not about money, it's about identity." Status > Price. This reframes the entire conversation.

---

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
> **"EMotorad Doodle Rs.56K | Trex Air Rs.35K | X1 Rs.25K"**

> **"EMI Starting Rs.999/month"**

> **FOUNDER:**
> "Doodle afford maadakke aagalla? Problem illa. Trex Air Rs.35K, X1 Rs.25K - same electric power, same speed, same throttle. Status different budgets alli siguththe BCH alli. Banni nodri."

*(Can't afford Doodle? No problem. Trex Air Rs.35K, X1 Rs.25K - same electric power, same speed, same throttle. Status at different budgets available at BCH. Come see.)*

- **VISUAL:** All three cycles side by side. Price tags visible. Staff available.
- **AUDIO:** Inclusive. "No judgment" energy. Every budget welcomed.

---

3. **Budget options** = Removes the Rs.56K sticker shock while keeping aspiration
4. **Real kids speaking** = More authentic than any scripted content
5. **Twist formula** = 4.24% share rate potential (Twisted Sagar's best performing format)

**Reaction 4 (0:18-0:23):**
- Father tries the e-cycle too. "Oh! Idu nangoo beku!" ("I want this too!"). Everyone laughs.

**Reaction 5 (0:23-0:28):**

> "1 year hinde, nanna 15th birthday ge appa nanne BCH ge karkond bandru. Naanu Doodle beku antha kelde - appa ge budget Rs.25K idithu. X1 togondru."

*(1 year ago, for my 15th birthday, dad brought me to BCH. I asked for Doodle - dad's budget was Rs.25K. We got the X1.)*

- **VISUAL:** Flashback feel (slightly different color grade). Dad and kid at BCH. Kid looking at Doodle, then at X1. Slight disappointment masked quickly. Dad's face - "This is what I can afford."
- **AUDIO:** Nostalgic music. Kid's honest voice.
- **VIRAL PATTERN:** The budget reality. Not everyone can afford Rs.56K. This represents 63% of BCH customers (non-rich segment). It's real, relatable, and honest.

**[0:15-0:30] THE JOURNEY - 1 Year Montage**

> **KID (voiceover continues):**
> "First week, school ge ride maadide - friends ella 'woah, electric cycle aa?' andru. Second month, daily tuition ge hogthidde. Rain bandaga mushkil aagthithu, aadre appa rain coat kottru."

---

**[0:30-0:45] THE EMOTIONAL PEAK**

> **KID (to camera, sincere):**
> "Appa, nange gottu Rs.25,000 nimage easy agirlilla. Nimage gottu - naanu X1 alla, Doodle beku antha idithu. Aadre appa... naanu innu heltini..."

- **AUDIO:** Guitar resolves. Warm. No hard sell voice.
- **NO PHONE NUMBER prominently** - soft CTA. Let the emotion drive search behavior.

---

### WHY THIS SCRIPT WILL GO VIRAL:
1. **Kid thanking parent** = THE most shareable content format in Indian family culture
2. **Budget honesty** = "We couldn't afford Doodle but X1 was enough" = relatable for 63% of market
3. **1-year proof** = Destroys "3-month drop" fear with real story

> "Indu ond dina alli 47 families bandru. 38 cycles sell aaytu. 15 test rides. 8 EMI approvals. 3 birthday celebrations. And 1 Gold customer came for service."

## The 7-Day Rule Implementation

Every script should trigger the 7-day visit window:
1. **Direct CTA scripts (1-7):** Phone number + "Banni" (Come) = Immediate action
2. **Soft CTA scripts (8-10):** Build desire that makes them search "BCH Yelahanka" within 7 days
3. **Follow-up content:** Post behind-the-scenes/store content between scripts to keep BCH top-of-mind
