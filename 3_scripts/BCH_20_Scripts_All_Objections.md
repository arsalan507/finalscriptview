| **Characters** | 3 (Syed Bhai, Teen Boy 1 as Father, Teen Boy 2 as Kid) |

## WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL

1. **RELATABLE MATH:** Every Indian parent drinks chai. ₹33 vs ₹60 is undeniable logic.
2. **SHAREABLE:** Kids will share this with parents saying "Appa nodi!" Parents will tag each other.
3. **MEME POTENTIAL:** "Your chai costs more than my happiness" = Instagram caption gold.
4. **EMI REFRAME:** ₹999/month or ₹33/day sounds way less scary than ₹56,000.
