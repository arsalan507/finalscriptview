## Content & Communication Insights

### Golden Rules

**1. Kannada Content ALWAYS Wins**
- Not "performs better" - ALWAYS wins
- Kannada-first, not bilingual
- English alienates core audience

**2. The 6-Second Rule**
- Entertainment in first 6 seconds
- Not education. Not features. Not benefits.
- ENTERTAINMENT = Survival

**3. Silent Watchers > Loud Engagers**
- Low engagement ≠ Low impact
- Few comments, few interactions
- BUT: They watch and buy
- Chase WATCH TIME and REACH, not engagement

**4. Content = Price Justification Engine**
- Creates premium perception
- Customers KNOW BCH is more expensive
- Still buy because of perceived value

### What Content Works
- MVP video (entertaining from second 1)
- "Badukinna buddi" YouTube video
- "999/- EMI" offer content
- Use-case explanation + excitement
- Celebrity association (Dhoni cycle)

### Communication Preferences
- Post-purchase contact: Phone calls (not WhatsApp/DMs)
- Prefer Kannada content
- Entertainment > Education
- Videos > Photos
