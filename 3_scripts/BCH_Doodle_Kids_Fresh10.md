SYED: "Sir, 40 km is throttle-only range. Pedal assist mode alli — battery double aaguthe. Real-world riding 80-100 km easy." (Sir, 40 km is throttle-only range. In pedal assist mode — battery doubles. Real-world riding of 80-100 km is easy.)

## SETUP [0:03-0:15]
(FLASHBACK TEXT: "6 MONTHS AGO")

(CUT TO: Home. SAMI showing Doodle on phone to ZUBAIR.)

SAMI: "Appa, EMotorad Doodle beku. BCH nalli ₹56,000." (Dad, I want the EMotorad Doodle. It's ₹56,000 at BCH.)

ZUBAIR (not looking up from newspaper): "Marks thogo munche. 85% mele bandre yochne maadthini." (Get marks first. If you score above 85%, I'll think about it.) [Classic dismissive father move]

SAMI: "Done Appa. 85% na? Promise?" (Done Dad. 85% right? Promise?)

ZUBAIR (chuckling, thinking it'll never happen): "Ha ha, promise. 85% thogo, Doodle nindhu." (Haha, promise. Get 85%, Doodle is yours.)

(SAMI's eyes narrow. Challenge accepted expression.)

## STORY ARC [0:15-0:35]
(TEXT: "WHAT HAPPENED NEXT")

SAMI (voiceover): "Naanu Doodle thogobeku antha plan maade. Aadre problem ondu ittu — naanu daily 4 hours phone nalli games aadthidde." (I made a plan to get the Doodle. But there was one problem — I was playing games on my phone 4 hours daily.)

(MONTAGE — Before Doodle goal:)

- SAMI sleeping through alarm at 6 AM
- SAMI yawning in class (stock/staged footage)
- Report card: 62%

SAMI (voiceover): "Aamele naanu decide maade — phone time cut. Instead, morning 6 AM cycling start maade. Friend's Doodle borrow maade." (Then I decided — cut phone time. Instead, started cycling at 6 AM. Borrowed a friend's Doodle.)

(MONTAGE — After Doodle goal:)
- SAMI riding at 6 AM, fresh morning
- SAMI at desk studying at 7:30 AM, alert and awake
- SAMI sleeping by 10 PM
- Phone screen time: 4 hours → 45 minutes

SAMI (voiceover): "Cycling start maadidmele — energy increase aaytu. Focus increase aaytu. Screen time 4 hours inda 45 minutes ge bantha." (After starting cycling — energy increased. Focus increased. Screen time went from 4 hours to 45 minutes.)

(CUT TO: TEACHER video call clip — staged/real)

TEACHER: "Hello, Sami's father na? Sami last 3 months alli class alli completely change aagidane. Attentive aagidane, homework daily submit maadthane." (Hello, is this Sami's father? Sami has completely changed in the last 3 months. He's attentive, submits homework daily.)

(ZUBAIR on the call, confused but happy.)

## CLIMAX + BRAND [0:35-0:50]

(ZUBAIR picks it up. Camera on his face.)

(Close-up of report card: 91%)

ZUBAIR: "91…" [Whisper. Looks at SAMI. Back at card. Back at SAMI.]

SAMI: "85% mele antha heldri Appa. 91% bandide. Doodle?" (You said above 85% Dad. I got 91%. Doodle?)

(Long pause. ZUBAIR's eyes well up. He didn't expect this.)

ZUBAIR: "Maga… naanu 85% condition hakiddu yaakandre naanu nambidde nee try ne maadalla antha. Nee prove maadide." (Son… I put the 85% condition because I believed you wouldn't even try. You proved me wrong.) [Voice cracking]

TEXT OVERLAYS:

ZUBAIR: "Syed Bhai, idu maga ge cycle alla… idu nanna ₹56,000 bet lose maadiddu." (Syed Bhai, this isn't a cycle for my son… this is me losing my ₹56,000 bet.) [Rubbing temples, mock pain]

SYED: "Sir, maga 91% thandidane. Neevu ₹56,000 happy aagi kodu." (Sir, your son got 91%. Pay the ₹56,000 happily.)

SAMI (to camera): "Appa ge heli — 'marks thogo munche.' Aamele marks bantaga — escape route illa." (Tell your dad — 'I'll get marks first.' Then when marks come — there's no escape route.) [Winks at camera]

1. SAMI approaches a speed bump. Slows down properly.
   AMMA's face: Small nod. Okay.

2. A car cuts in suddenly. SAMI brakes smoothly. No panic.
   AMMA's face: Hand goes to chest briefly. Then relief.

   AMMA's face: Eyes widen. "Idu enu?" (What's this?)
   SAMI: "Speed lock Amma. 25 kmph mele hogoke biddalla." (Speed lock Mom. It won't let me go above 25 kmph.)

(CUT TO: Next morning. SAMI walks to ZUBAIR at the breakfast table. Places the jar on the table.)

ZUBAIR (looking up from tea): "Idu enu maga?" (What's this son?)

SAMI: "Appa, 2 years birthday money, Diwali money, Ajji kodiddu — ella illi ide. ₹5,000." (Dad, 2 years of birthday money, Diwali money, what Ajji gave — it's all here. ₹5,000.) [Pushing the jar forward]

ZUBAIR: "Yaake nange kodthidya?" (Why are you giving it to me?) [Confused]

SAMI: "Appa, naanu Doodle beku antha kelalla — yaakandre ninge pressure aaguthe antha gothittu." (Dad, I never asked for the Doodle — because I knew it would pressure you.)

(ZUBAIR stops mid-sip. Tea cup slowly lowered.)

SAMI: "Aadre Syed Bhai heldru — EMI ₹999 per month ge siguthe antha. Appa, ₹999 EMI + nanna ₹5,000 down payment. Naanu mundhina birthday money kooda ella EMI ge haakthini. Ninge burden aagbaardhu." (But Syed Bhai told me — it's available at ₹999 EMI per month. Dad, ₹999 EMI + my ₹5,000 as down payment. I'll put all my future birthday money towards EMI too. I don't want to be a burden on you.)

(ZUBAIR puts down the tea cup. His hands are shaking slightly.)

ZUBAIR: "Maga… nee burden alla…" (Son… you're not a burden…) [Voice breaking]

SAMI: "Appa, nange gothide neevu nannge ella kodthidira. School bag, shoes, tuition — kelilla yaavathru. Idu naanu nannge kodkonthidini." (Dad, I know you give me everything. School bag, shoes, tuition — I never asked. This, I'm giving to myself.)

(ZUBAIR looks at the jar. Looks at the small denominations. ₹10 notes that SAMI saved for months. A ₹20 note folded carefully. His eyes fill up.)

## CLIMAX + BRAND [0:35-0:50]
(Long pause. ZUBAIR picks up the jar. Opens it. Takes out all the money. Places it back in SAMI's hand.)

ZUBAIR (tears streaming, trying to hold composure): "Idu ninna money maga. Ninna savings. Idu ninna pocket alli ittkond iru." (This is your money son. Your savings. Keep this in your pocket.)

SAMI: "Aadre Appa, Doodle…?" (But Dad, Doodle…?)

ZUBAIR: "Doodle NANDHU. EMI NANDHU. Ninna birthday money spend maadbaarda nanna maga ge cycle kodoke." (Doodle is ON ME. EMI is ON ME. I won't let my son spend his birthday money to buy himself a cycle.) [Standing up, wiping eyes firmly]

(CUT TO: BCH Store. ZUBAIR walks in with SAMI. SYED at the counter.)

ZUBAIR (to SYED, still emotional): "Syed Bhai, Doodle pack maadi. EMI ₹999 start maadi. Nanna maga 2 years save maadidane ee cycle ge. Naanu ond minute late maadalla." (Syed Bhai, pack the Doodle. Start the ₹999 EMI. My son saved for 2 years for this cycle. I won't delay one more minute.)

SYED (understanding the weight of the moment, quietly): "Sir, best decision. Sami, ninna Doodle ready." (Sir, best decision. Sami, your Doodle is ready.)

TEXT OVERLAYS:
- "EMotorad Doodle — ₹999/month EMI"

- "No Cost EMI Options ✅"

## COMEDY PAYOFF + CTA [0:50-0:59]
(SAMI on Doodle, ready to ride out. Helmet on. Beaming.)

SAMI: "Appa…" [Turns back]

ZUBAIR: "Enu maga?" (What son?)

SAMI: "₹5,000 savings iddhe na nanna haththra… adu nimage biryani treat." (I still have ₹5,000 in savings right… that's a biryani treat for you.) [Big smile]

(ZUBAIR laughs through tears. Grabs SAMI in a bear hug.)

ZUBAIR: "Maga, keep your money. Aadre biryani… naan kodthini." (Son, keep your money. But biryani… I'll treat.) [Ruffling his hair]

SYED (to camera, wiping his own eye): "₹999 per month. Maga ge cycle. Appa ge pride. Adu beyond price." (₹999 per month. A cycle for the son. Pride for the father. That's beyond price.) [Genuine emotion]
