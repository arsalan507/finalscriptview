```

**VISUAL:** Close-up of a phone screen showing a WhatsApp forwarded screenshot — cycle at ₹38,000. A hand (Syed Bhai) gently pushes the phone DOWN revealing his face — smiling confidently.

**AUDIO:** WhatsApp notification sound → Dramatic pause → Bass drop

---

## SETUP [0:03-0:15]

*(CUT TO: BCH Store. Father walks in with Kid. Holds phone up to Syed Bhai's face.)*

**FATHER (Teen Boy 1 playing Father):** "Syed Bhai! Same Aoki Flex CR — online ₹38,000! Nimdu ₹56,000! ₹18,000 DIFFERENCE! Yaakaagidhe?!"
*(Syed Bhai! Same Aoki Flex CR — online ₹38,000! Yours ₹56,000! ₹18,000 DIFFERENCE! Why?!)*

"Sir... idu nodi... yaaru forward maadiddu?"
*(Sir... look at this... who forwarded this?)*

**FATHER:** "Friends WhatsApp group alli."
*(In friends WhatsApp group.)*

**SYED BHAI:** "Okay sir... iga TRUTH show maadthini. Ready aa?"
*(Okay sir... now I'll show you the TRUTH. Ready?)*

---

## STORY ARC [0:15-0:35]

*(Syed Bhai opens his own phone. Goes to same website.)*

**SYED BHAI:** "Sir... ₹38,000 correct. Aadre idu NODI..."
*[Scrolls down]*

**SCREEN RECORDING on Syed Bhai's phone (shown to camera):**

1. **Shipping:** "+ ₹2,500 (Bangalore extra)"
2. **Assembly:** "Self-assembly (NO mechanic)"
3. **Warranty:** "Brand warranty only — NO local service"

**FATHER:** "But still ₹4,000 less than yours!"

**SYED BHAI:** "Correct sir. Aadre namma ₹56,000 nalli..."
*(Correct sir. But in our ₹56,000...)*

---

## CLIMAX + BRAND [0:35-0:50]

*(Syed Bhai pulls out a board — BCH VALUE COMPARISON)*

**SYED BHAI:** "BCH ₹56,000 = Cycle + FREE Delivery + FREE Assembly + 15 FREE Accessories (worth ₹8,500) + LOCAL Service (25 years) + Test Ride + Exchange + EMI from ₹999!"

*[Points at each item]*

"Online ₹52,000 = Cycle + Prayer. Service problem? Call center. Parts problem? Courier back. 2 weeks minimum!"

**FATHER:** *[Looking at phone, looking at board, back and forth]*

"So actually... BCH is CHEAPER?!"

**SYED BHAI:** "₹4,000 extra for ₹8,500 accessories + LIFETIME service + ZERO tension? Sir... idu expensive alla, idu INVESTMENT!"

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
```
"BCH ₹56K = EVERYTHING INCLUDED | Online ₹52K = CYCLE ONLY | YOU DO THE MATH 🧮"
```

---

## COMEDY PAYOFF + CTA [0:50-0:59]

**FATHER:** *[Opens WhatsApp group, types message, shows to camera]*

Message reads: "GUYS STOP FORWARDING ONLINE PRICES. I WENT TO BCH. ONLINE IS ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE. 😂"

## PRODUCTION NOTES

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Characters** | 3 (Syed Bhai, Teen Boy 1 as Son on phone call, Teen Boy 2 as "Ajji" with costume) |
| **Props** | Dupatta/shawl for Ajji costume, EMotorad e-cycle, market bags, phone for call scene, filter coffee cup |

| **Comedy Element** | Teen boy playing Ajji = automatic laughs + shares |
| **Estimated Cuts** | 20-25 |

---

## WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL

1. **AJJI LOVE:** India LOVES grandmother content. Instant emotional connection + shares.
2. **BOY PLAYING AJJI:** Teen boy in shawl playing 75-year-old = COMEDY GOLD. Comment section will explode.
3. **GREY MARKET UNTAPPED:** No cycle brand targets seniors. This positions BCH as inclusive.
4. **HEALTH ANGLE:** Doctor saying BP down = parents/kids will share with their own grandparents.
5. **"HAPPY WORRIED":** The son's line — "worried but happy worried" — is quotable and emotional.

## WHY THIS WILL GO VIRAL

1. **SCHOOL STATUS:** Every teenager understands the "cool kid" hierarchy. This HITS that nerve.
2. **FOMO TRIGGER:** Kids watching this will immediately want to be the "New Kid" — pure FOMO marketing.
3. **SELFIE WITH CYCLE:** The visual of kids photographing a CYCLE is funny, shareable, and relatable for this generation.
4. **"3 YEARS ZERO FRIENDS":** Exaggerated but relatable — the quiet kid narrative triggers empathy + comedy.
5. **PARENTS CALLING IN BACKGROUND:** The ending with other kids calling parents = chain reaction FOMO that viewers will enact in real life.
