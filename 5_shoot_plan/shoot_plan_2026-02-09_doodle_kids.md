## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 15 minutes (prop placement, Doodle cleaning/positioning, mic check, lighting test)

- **Shot order:** Shoot 1-4 first (entrance area), then 5-13 (counter area), then 14-15 (product hero last for best lighting)

## Product Placement Notes
- **When Doodle appears:** Background from shot 1, hero focus from shot 8 onward
- **How it's shown:** Initially blurred in background (mystery/desire), then full reveal in shot 14 with low-angle hero framing, lights on, clean body visible
- **Feature callouts:** Price point (₹55,999), visual comparison to iPhone cost, physical presence of the cycle
- **Naturalness check:** The Doodle is the object of desire throughout — the kid wants it, the father resists, the price comparison breaks the resistance. Never feels like an ad because the conflict is real and relatable.

## Script Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Title | Unboxing Nightmare — The Sequel |
| Format | Video-call drama — In-store kid vs. online-buy disaster friend |
| Duration | 50-60 seconds |
| Platform | Instagram Reel (9:16 vertical) |
| Language | Street Kannada |
| Hook Type | Horror/comedy — unboxing gone wrong |
| Target Audience | Parents comparing online vs. store prices |
| Objection Attacked | "I'll get it cheaper online" |
| Product | EMotorad Doodle |

## Crew Assignments
| Role | Actor | Reason | Alternative |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Syed Bhai (store narrator) | Syed | Guides the moral of the story, delivers the closer | — |
| Kid at BCH Store | Sami | 16, in-store kid who made the right choice, smug energy | Appi |
| Friend on video call (wrong cycle) | Zubair | Great personality, plays panicked/frustrated comedy perfectly, very expressive | Sanjay |

## Equipment Checklist
- [ ] **iPhone 15 Pro Max** — 4K 30fps for store scenes. For video call: pre-record Zubair's side separately on a second phone, then play it back during Sami's reaction shots. 120fps slow-mo for the "wrong cycle reveal" moment.
- [ ] **Audio** — DJI Mic on Syed for narration. Zubair's audio recorded separately during his video-call performance (clean audio, add phone filter in edit). Sami's reactions mostly visual.
- [ ] **Lighting** — Store interior: standard LED panel. Zubair's location (his "home"): messy room lighting, slightly dim/unflattering to contrast with clean BCH store.
- [ ] **Props** — EMotorad Doodle (pristine, on display), second phone for video call screen, a WRONG/cheap-looking regular cycle (borrow from store — scratched, wrong color, missing parts for comedy), torn cardboard box, packing peanuts scattered, crumpled invoice printout
- [ ] **Wardrobe** — Syed: BCH uniform. Sami: casual, relaxed, confident kid. Zubair: messy home clothes — undershirt, hair messed up, stressed look.

## Location Setup
- **Primary:** BCH Store interior (Sami's side) + separate corner/back room dressed as "friend's house" (Zubair's side)
- **Backup:** Zubair's scenes can be shot at any indoor location with different wall/background
- **Set dressing:** BCH store side: clean, bright, Doodle on display looking perfect. "Friend's house" side: cardboard box torn open, wrong cycle leaning against wall, packing material everywhere, chaos.

| 4 | CUT TO Zubair's side — he holds up the WRONG cycle | Wide shot at "home" — Zubair with wrong cycle | 3s | Wrong color, wrong size, missing pedal. Zubair's face = devastation. Cardboard everywhere. |
| 5 | Back to Sami — jaw drops, then tries not to laugh | Close-up on Sami | 2s | Cinematic mode. Hand over mouth. Eyes wide. Slight shoulder shake from holding laughter. |
| 6 | Zubair shows invoice on camera — "Online helli 8000 save andre!" | Phone screen close-up, Zubair holding invoice | 3s | Crumpled paper. Zubair reads amount. Voice: pure regret. |
| 7 | Zubair: "Return policy — 'NO RETURNS ON CYCLES'" — zooms into text | Phone screen, Zubair pointing at fine print | 2s | Comedy gold. Zubair's finger shaking as he points. |
| 8 | Sami slowly turns camera to show his Doodle — pristine, lights on | Medium, Sami pans to Doodle in store | 3s | Slow, deliberate pan. Doodle gleaming. BCH store clean background. |
| 9 | Zubair on call: "Yaarru guru adhu?!" — jealous | Phone screen, Zubair leaning into camera | 2s | Face pressed against phone screen comedy. |
| 10 | Syed Bhai walks into frame — "Onlinealli cycle thogthaare guru?" | Medium, Syed enters behind Sami | 3s | Syed shakes head. Disappointed-father energy. |
| 11 | Syed: "Store alli thogri — test ride maadi, check maadi, happy aagi hogi" | Medium on Syed, gesturing to store | 4s | Points around store. Professional but warm. |
| 12 | INSERT — Quick shots: Sami test-riding Doodle, checking brakes, adjusting seat | 3 quick cuts, different angles | 3s | 1 second each. Show the in-store experience. |
| 13 | Back to call — Zubair: "Mundhina saari naan BCH ge barthini" | Phone screen, Zubair defeated | 2s | Head down. Genuine. |
| 14 | FINAL — Sami hangs up, pats Doodle, looks at camera: "Store > Online" | Medium on Sami with Doodle | 2s | Sami winks. Hand on Doodle seat. |
| 15 | FREEZE + TEXT: "Don't gamble online. Test ride at BCH." + logo | Wide shot, Sami on Doodle, Syed behind counter | 2s | Clean composition. |

## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 25 minutes (two locations need dressing — clean store side + messy home side. Wrong cycle sourcing and positioning.)
- **Estimated shoot time:** 50 minutes (Zubair's side shot separately first, then Sami's side with phone playback for reactions)
- **Shot order:** Shoot all Zubair "home" scenes first (shots 4, 6, 7, 9, 13). Then shoot all Sami/Syed BCH scenes (shots 1-3, 5, 8, 10-12, 14-15). Phone screen shots composited in edit.

## Product Placement Notes
- **When Doodle appears:** Background from shot 2, hero reveal in shot 8, insert shots in 12, final shot 14
- **How it's shown:** Pristine, gleaming, lights on — maximum contrast with the "wrong cycle" disaster. The Doodle represents "the right choice."
- **Feature callouts:** In-store test ride experience, visual quality/build, BCH store service
- **Naturalness check:** The comedy of the online disaster carries the video. Doodle wins by being the obvious better choice — no hard features dump. The moral is "buy from a store" and Doodle happens to be the perfect store product.

|--------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | HOOK — Mysterious figure in saree watching from behind a wall | Wide, slightly shaky handheld | 2s | Zubair in full Ajji costume. Only back/side visible. Binoculars raised. Suspenseful music cue. |
| 2 | REVEAL — Sami rides past on Doodle, carefree | Medium wide tracking | 2s | Sami rides smoothly. Doesn't notice Ajji. Natural outdoor light. |
| 3 | Ajji shuffles to next hiding spot — behind a tree | Wide, comedic timing | 2s | Zubair waddles in saree. Walking stick tucked under arm. Comedy gold. |
| 4 | Syed VO: "Hardhina Sami ride maadthidda... yaaro follow maadthidru" | Medium on Sami riding, oblivious | 3s | VO recorded separately. Sami rides, looks back once, sees nothing. |
| 5 | Ajji behind a parked auto — peeks over, binoculars on | Close-up on Ajji's face (Zubair) — binoculars pressed to face | 2s | Reading glasses OVER the binoculars. Comedy detail. Excited expression. |
| 6 | Sami stops at a chai stall/bench — checks phone GPS | Medium on Sami at rest | 2s | Sami swipes phone. Route map visible. Takes a sip of water. |
| 7 | Ajji appears on bench RIGHT NEXT to him — "Hava chennagide alwa?" (nice breeze, no?) | Medium wide, both on bench | 3s | Sami startled. Double-takes. Ajji acts innocent, adjusts saree. |
| 8 | Sami: "AJJI?! Neevu yaake illi?!" | Close-up on Sami, shocked | 2s | Pure disbelief. Mouth open. |
| 9 | Ajji drops the act: "Nange idu beku! Doodle! Naan try maadbahudu?!" | Medium on Ajji (Zubair), excited | 3s | Throws walking stick aside dramatically. Grabs Doodle handlebar. Full energy shift from frail to excited. |

| 11 | Sami running alongside: "Ajji! Mella! MELLA!" | Medium tracking, Sami jogging | 2s | Role reversal comedy. Kid worried, grandma fearless. |
| 12 | CUT TO BCH Store — Syed: "Ajji ge safe aa? 25 kmph speed lock. Pedal assist. Even Ajji can ride." | Medium on Syed at counter | 4s | Calm, factual. Points at Doodle on display. |
| 13 | INSERT — Close-ups: speed lock display, pedal assist mechanism, comfortable seat | 3 quick product shots | 3s | 1 second each. Clean macro shots. |

## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 30 minutes (Zubair's Ajji costume is the bottleneck — saree draping, wig/dupatta, glasses, padding, practice walking)
- **Estimated shoot time:** 55 minutes (outdoor shots need multiple takes for comedy timing, Ajji-on-Doodle needs safety checks)
- **Shot order:** Outdoor first (shots 1-11, 14) while natural light is good. Store interior last (shots 12-13, 15). Costume stays on throughout.

## Product Placement Notes
- **When Doodle appears:** Shot 2 onward (Sami riding), hero focus shots 9-10 and 13-14
- **How it's shown:** As something so easy and fun that even a grandma wants to ride it. The comedy framing makes the product desirable across ages.
- **Feature callouts:** 25 kmph speed lock (safe for all ages), pedal assist (easy to ride), comfortable seat
- **Naturalness check:** The comedy carries everything. Ajji's desire for the Doodle is the punchline. Product features are delivered as safety assurance, not a sales pitch. The grandma costume ensures shareability.

## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 15 minutes (whiteboard prep, GPS app setup, Doodle full charge check, starting line tape)
- **Estimated shoot time:** 50 minutes (riding montage inserts shot separately — need 4 different street backgrounds. Store scenes done in one block.)
- **Shot order:** Outdoor montage inserts first (shot 7) across different locations. Then store exterior (shots 1-6, 12, 15-16). Then store interior/counter (shots 8-11, 13-14).

## Product Placement Notes
- **When Doodle appears:** Shot 6 onward — it's the vehicle being tested throughout
- **How it's shown:** As a machine that delivers on its promise. The GPS tracker is the proof. 100 km is the undeniable evidence.
- **Feature callouts:** 40 km range on single charge, pedal assist extending range, GPS tracking capability, battery reliability
- **Naturalness check:** The bet format makes the audience root for the kid. They want the Doodle to succeed. By the time features are mentioned (shot 14), the audience already believes because they watched the journey. The sell is earned.

## Crew Assignments

## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 20 minutes (report card printing/prep, lighting for emotional scenes, wardrobe, Doodle positioning)
- **Estimated shoot time:** 45 minutes (emotional scenes need careful pacing — allow extra takes for Zubair's reaction in shots 7-8)
- **Shot order:** Insert shots first if different location (shot 12 — Sami riding, studying, sleeping). Then chronological: "3 months ago" scenes (1-3), then present scenes (4-16) all at BCH store.

## Product Placement Notes

- **How it's shown:** As the catalyst for positive change. Not a toy but a tool. Present in the store environment naturally.
- **Feature callouts:** Cycling benefits (focus, sleep, energy), daily ride routine, positioning as investment vs. toy
- **Naturalness check:** The emotional arc carries everything — bad grades to good grades. Doodle is credited by the kid and validated by the store expert. The father's journey from "waste of money" to "best investment" is the real story. Product is the hero because the story makes it one.

## Crew Assignments

## Shot List (In Shooting Order)
| Shot # | Description | Camera | Duration | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | HOOK — Helmet cam POV: hands reach for Doodle handlebars, mount, kick off | POV/first-person, wide angle | 2s | Shaky, authentic. See hands grip handlebars. Doodle dashboard visible. Street ahead. |

| 4 | Syed VO: "Prathi dina, avn ride maadthane. Amma ge gotthilla — camera ide antha" | Same POV footage continuing | 3s | VO layered over helmet cam footage. Sami waves at a friend on the road. |
| 5 | CUT TO — "THAT NIGHT" text. Dark room. Phone screen glowing on a face. | Medium, Amma (Zubair) lit by phone screen | 2s | Dramatic shift. Zubair in full Amma costume. Phone held close. Blue screen light on face. |
| 6 | Amma is watching the helmet cam footage on the phone — we see the screen | Over-shoulder, phone screen visible | 3s | Same footage we just watched, now on Amma's phone. Amma's finger scrolls. Concerned face. |
| 7 | Amma sees the traffic crossing clip — hand goes to mouth | Close-up on Amma's face | 2s | Cinematic mode. Worry lines. Hand covers mouth. Slight gasp. |
| 8 | Amma sees Sami stopping safely, following rules — relief exhale | Close-up on Amma, expression shifts | 2s | Worry melts into relief. Small smile forming. Eyes soften. |
| 9 | Amma sees Sami's speed on screen: 15 kmph in residential area | Close-up on phone screen showing speed | 1.5s | Clear speed reading. Safe number. |

| 11 | Amma smiles — scrolls to clip of Sami parking Doodle, taking off helmet, smiling at camera | Phone screen showing Sami's smile, then cut to Amma smiling | 3s | Mirror smiles — kid smiles on screen, Amma smiles watching. Emotional. |
| 12 | Amma puts phone down, picks up tea, whispers: "Safe aagi bandnalla" (He came back safe) | Medium on Amma, warm lighting | 3s | Quiet moment. Tea sip. Genuine relief. Hold the silence for emotional weight. |

| 16 | TEXT: "Amma can't ride with him. But Doodle keeps him safe." + BCH logo | Same frame, frozen | 2s | Emotional closer. |

## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 30 minutes (Amma costume for Zubair, helmet cam mount setup and test, "home" set dressing in back room, outdoor route scouting)
- **Estimated shoot time:** 60 minutes (helmet cam footage needs a full ride-through — plan a 5-minute route and shoot continuously, then pick best clips. Amma scenes need mood lighting setup. BCH store scenes quickest.)
- **Shot order:** 1. Outdoor helmet cam (shots 1-4) — needs daylight. 2. "Home" Amma scenes (shots 5-12) — can be any time since it's dim interior. 3. BCH store (shots 13-16). 4. Split screen composed in edit.

## Product Placement Notes
- **When Doodle appears:** From shot 1 (handlebars visible in POV), throughout riding footage, product close-ups in shot 14, referenced throughout
- **How it's shown:** Through the eyes of the rider (POV) and the eyes of a worried mother. The safety features are the star — speed lock, lights, control.
- **Feature callouts:** 25 kmph speed lock, LED headlights/taillights, pedal assist for control, overall safety design
- **Naturalness check:** This is a mother's story told through found footage. The emotional hook is a parent watching their child ride safely. Product features emerge as the reason for safety, not as a spec sheet. The audience feels Amma's worry and relief — Doodle is the reason she can relax.

| 11 | Sami: "Appa, ₹153! Biryani ginta cheap!" | Medium on Sami, excited | 2s | Kid jumps in. The math hits. |

## Product Placement Notes

- **Naturalness check:** The biryani comparison is hilarious and relatable for Bangalore dads. The math does the selling — Syed just facilitates. No hard pitch. The audience does the calculation themselves and goes "wait, that's actually cheap."

## Crew Assignments
| Role | Actor | Reason | Alternative |

## Equipment Checklist
- [ ] **iPhone 15 Pro Max** — 4K 30fps primary camera (Zubair holds, follows action). Second phone for Syed's "LIVE" screen if simulating IG Live. 120fps slow-mo for the speed lock activation moment. Screen record the Doodle speedometer/display if it shows speed.
- [ ] **Audio** — DJI Mic on Syed (continuous commentary). Zubair's commentary from behind camera picked up by phone mic. Wind noise during riding is acceptable — adds authenticity to "live" feel.
- [ ] **Lighting** — Full outdoor natural light. Choose a time when road is well-lit but not harsh midday. Speed display on Doodle needs to be readable — angle camera to reduce screen glare.
- [ ] **Props** — EMotorad Doodle (fully charged), speedometer/phone app showing real-time speed, cone markers or tape for "speed test zone" on road, Syed's phone (showing "LIVE" to simulate Instagram), stopwatch optional

## Location Setup

| 1 | HOOK — Syed to camera: "LIVE aa idheevi! Doodle speed lock — real aa fake aa? Eevaaga test!" | Medium, Syed direct to camera, handheld energy | 3s | IG Live energy — raw, unpolished, excited. Syed waves. Zubair behind camera: "Live start aaytu boss!" |
| 2 | Syed walks to Sami on Doodle at start line: "Sami ready aa?" | Medium wide, walking | 2s | Sami on Doodle at cone markers. Thumbs up. Helmet on. |
| 3 | Syed: "Speed lock 25 kmph antha helthaare. Max speed try maadu" | Medium on Syed, then pan to Sami | 2s | Challenge set. Sami nods, grips handlebars. |
| 4 | Close-up on Doodle speedometer/display: showing 0 km/h | Extreme close-up on dashboard | 1.5s | Clean shot of the display. Starting at zero. |
| 5 | Sami takes off — accelerates on Doodle | Wide, tracking shot (Zubair walks/jogs alongside) | 3s | Doodle accelerates. Sami pedals hard. Speed building visually. |
| 6 | INSERT — Speedometer climbing: 10... 15... 20... 23... 24... 25 — STOPS | Close-up on speed display, multiple cuts | 3s | Pre-record this. Numbers climb and STOP at 25. Hold on 25. |
| 7 | Sami tries to go faster — pedals harder — speed stays at 25 | Medium on Sami from side, straining | 3s | Comedy: Sami standing on pedals, pumping hard. Doodle stays at 25. Sami looks confused/frustrated. |
| 8 | Syed commentating: "Dekho! 25 ke upar jaata hi nahi! Speed lock REAL hai!" | Medium on Syed, excited pointing | 2s | Hype energy. Pointing at Sami. |
| 9 | Zubair from behind camera: "MAGA! Jaasthi hogalla?!" — laughing | Audio only + shaky camera (Zubair laughing) | 1.5s | Camera shakes from Zubair laughing. Authentic live energy. |
| 10 | Sami stops, gets off: "Guru 25 ke upar hogalla! I tried full!" | Medium on Sami, slightly out of breath | 3s | Genuine. Takes off helmet. Shakes head in disbelief but smiling. |
| 11 | Syed to camera: "Parents — 25 kmph max. Road crossing speed. Not highway speed." | Medium on Syed, serious shift | 3s | Shifts from hype to reassuring. Calm, factual. Direct address to parents watching. |
| 12 | INSERT — Comparison text (added in edit): "25 kmph = jogging speed" with visual | Static shot for text overlay | 2s | Editor adds comparison graphic. |

## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 15 minutes (cone placement, speed test zone marking, Doodle charge check, "LIVE" phone setup, helmet check)
- **Estimated shoot time:** 40 minutes (speed test runs need 3-4 takes for best camera angles. Commentary is largely improvised — fewer retakes.)
- **Shot order:** All outdoor in sequence (shots 1-16). Shoot the speedometer close-ups (shots 4, 6) separately with controlled camera on a stable surface. Wide riding shots and commentary shot in continuous takes for authentic energy.

## Product Placement Notes
- **When Doodle appears:** From shot 2 throughout — it IS the test subject
- **How it's shown:** As a scientifically testable product. The speed lock is proven live, not just claimed. The display shows real numbers.
- **Feature callouts:** 25 kmph speed lock (primary), pedal assist, parental control over speed, safe design
- **Naturalness check:** The "LIVE test" format is inherently authentic — you can't fake a speed lock. The audience sees the proof with their own eyes. Sami's genuine inability to exceed 25 kmph is the most convincing product demo possible. No scripted pitch needed.

| Narrator (Syed Bhai VO + end appearance) | Syed | Voiceover for emotional narration, appears at end for EMI reveal, one-take closer delivery | — |
| Father | Zubair | Great personality, plays the financially-stretched-but-loving dad arc, can show vulnerability + pride, very expressive | Sanjay |
| Kid with savings jar | Sami | 16, plays the determined kid saving up, innocent ambition energy, good actor for emotional beats | Appi |

## Equipment Checklist
- [ ] **iPhone 15 Pro Max** — 4K 30fps for story scenes, 120fps slow-mo for coin-dropping moments and the birthday reveal, cinematic mode for close-ups on the jar, faces, and the EMI card/screen
- [ ] **Audio** — Syed VO recorded separately in quiet room with DJI Mic close (warm, intimate narration). Dialogue scenes: DJI Mic on Zubair. Sami has minimal lines — on-camera mic sufficient. Ambient sounds (coins clinking) captured live.
- [ ] **Lighting** — "Home" scenes: warm, soft lighting (lamp + one LED panel with warm gel). Coin jar scenes: spotlight/focused light on jar for visual emphasis. BCH store: standard bright retail lighting for contrast with home warmth.
- [ ] **Props** — Glass jar (transparent, half-filled with coins and small notes), coins (various denominations for sound and visuals), small birthday card ("Happy Birthday Sami" — handwritten), EMotorad Doodle (on display at BCH), phone/screen showing EMI plan (₹999/month or similar), birthday candle (single candle, for emotional beat), calendar with birthday date circled, piggy bank optional
- [ ] **Wardrobe** — Syed: BCH uniform (store scene only). Zubair (Father): simple home clothes — vest/T-shirt (home scenes), slightly better for store visit. Sami: home clothes, maybe a birthday T-shirt or cap for the reveal.

## Location Setup
- **Primary:** Indoor "home" setup (BCH back room dressed as kid's room/living room) + BCH Store for EMI reveal
- **Backup:** Any indoor corner with plain wall for "home" — keep it simple and relatable
- **Set dressing:** "Kid's room": small desk, the savings jar prominently placed, calendar on wall with birthday circled, maybe a Doodle poster/printout on wall (showing the dream). "Living room": simple sofa/chair for father's scene. BCH store: Doodle on display, counter for EMI discussion.

## Shot List (In Shooting Order)
| Shot # | Description | Camera | Duration | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | HOOK — Extreme close-up: a coin drops into a glass jar, CLINK sound | Macro close-up, 120fps slow-mo | 2s | The coin falls in slow-mo. Jar half-full. Clink reverberates. Intimate. |
| 2 | Pull back — Sami sitting at desk, dropping another coin in. Calendar visible with date circled. | Medium on Sami | 2s | Syed VO: "Sami ge ondu dream ittu." Sami counts coins quietly. |
| 3 | Close-up on calendar — birthday date circled with "DOODLE DAY" written | Close-up on calendar | 1.5s | Handwritten. Kid's writing. Heart drawn next to it. |
| 4 | INSERT — Sami's savings routine: returns change from errands, skips ice cream, adds to jar | 3 quick montage clips | 3s | 1 second each. VO: "Prathi dina save maadthidda." Small sacrifices. Relatable. |
| 5 | Jar growing fuller over time (2-3 shots showing progression) | Close-up on jar, dissolve edits | 2s | Quarter full, half full, three-quarter full. Visual progress. |
| 6 | Sami counts jar total — face falls — not enough | Close-up on Sami counting, then face | 3s | Sami pours coins, counts with lips moving. Realization: not enough. Shoulders drop. |
| 7 | Syed VO: "₹56,000 — doddha number. Chikka kaigalli kashta" (big number, hard for small hands) | Same shot, Sami staring at jar | 2s | Emotional beat. Hold on Sami's face. Let it breathe. |
| 8 | Zubair (father) watches from doorway — has seen everything | Medium, Zubair in doorframe | 2s | Cinematic mode. Zubair's face: pride in his kid's effort + pain that he can't just buy it. |
| 9 | Night scene — father sitting alone, pulls out phone, searching | Medium on Zubair in chair, phone light on face | 3s | Scrolling. Searching "Doodle EMI options" or "BCH Yelahanka." Quiet determination. |
| 10 | CUT TO — BCH Store. Zubair walks in with Sami. Sami doesn't know why. | Wide, store entrance | 2s | Sami confused. Looks around. Zubair has a slight smile. |
| 11 | Syed at counter: "Welcome! EMI ready maadidheeni, sir" | Medium, Syed greeting them | 2s | Syed and Zubair exchange knowing look over Sami's head. |
| 12 | Syed shows phone/screen: "₹999 per month. That's it." | Close-up on screen showing EMI breakdown | 3s | ₹999/month clearly visible. Reasonable number. Syed: "Per month, sir. Jar alli iddhakinta kammi." |
| 13 | Sami's face — confusion turning to realization | Close-up on Sami, cinematic mode | 2s | Looks at EMI screen. Looks at Doodle on display. Looks at father. Eyes widen. |
| 14 | Sami: "Appa...? Seriously?!" | Medium on Sami, voice cracking | 2s | Sami's hands go to mouth. Eyes watering optional. Genuine. |
| 15 | Zubair puts hand on Sami's shoulder: "Ninn savings + ₹999 EMI. Birthday gift." | Medium on both, father and son | 3s | 120fps slow-mo. Zubair pulls out the birthday card. Hands it to Sami. "Happy Birthday." |
| 16 | Sami hugs Zubair — jar of coins on counter | Wide shot, store | 3s | Emotional climax. Jar visible on counter. Doodle in background. Syed smiles watching. |
| 17 | INSERT — Close-up: jar of coins next to EMI receipt next to Doodle price tag | Macro, three items in frame | 2s | Visual summary: kid's effort + EMI solution = dream achieved. |
| 18 | FINAL — Sami on Doodle outside BCH, Zubair beside, birthday candle on handlebar (quirky) | Wide, warm lighting | 2s | FREEZE. Birthday candle = single candle on handlebar. Sami blows it out. |
| 19 | TEXT: "₹999/month. Every kid deserves a Doodle birthday." + BCH logo | Same frame, frozen | 2s | Text overlay. EMI number prominent. |

## Shooting Schedule
- **Setup time:** 25 minutes ("home" set dressing — desk, jar, calendar, coins. BCH store Doodle positioning. Coin jar needs to be pre-filled to various levels for progression shots.)
- **Estimated shoot time:** 55 minutes (home scenes need emotional pacing — allow extra takes for shots 6-8 and 13-15. BCH store scenes are dialogue-driven — Syed's one-take ability helps. Outdoor final shot quick.)
- **Shot order:** 1. "Home" scenes first (shots 1-9) — all in dressed back room. 2. BCH store scenes (shots 10-17) — counter area. 3. Outdoor final (shot 18-19) — store front. 4. VO recorded last, separately.

## Product Placement Notes
- **When Doodle appears:** Referenced throughout (calendar, dream), physically from shot 10 onward at BCH, hero shot 18
- **How it's shown:** As a dream worth saving for. The jar of coins humanizes the desire. The Doodle is earned, not just bought. Final shot is the payoff.
- **Feature callouts:** EMI option (₹999/month — primary), affordability, BCH store financing, birthday/gifting angle
- **Naturalness check:** This is a story about a father's love and a kid's determination. The EMI is the solution that makes the dream possible — not a sales gimmick. The audience feels the kid's journey and roots for him. The ₹999 reveal is the climax, not a pitch. Viewers will share this because it's emotional, not because it's an ad.
